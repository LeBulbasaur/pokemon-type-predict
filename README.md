### AI Training Project

# Project Description

This project was created as part of my self-learning journey in AI, based on the book 'Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow' by Aurélien Géron.
This project contains a script for training an AI model. It includes data processing, model building, and training implementation.

# Dependencies

The project uses the following libraries:

- Python 3.x

- TensorFlow/PyTorch (depending on implementation)

- NumPy

- Pandas

- Scikit-learn

- Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)
